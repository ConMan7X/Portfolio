# NCSFood

I maintain and post on a website and social media called NCSFood where we write
reviews or comments about food and restaurants that we experience.

While this project is mainly a passion project where I get to share my love
of certain foods and restaurants, it has also helped me further develop my skills.
Specifically with Git, Github, and static site development/hosting.

_Technology Utilised: Hugo, Markdown, Github_
