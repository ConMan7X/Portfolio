# Football Analysis Project Blog

## 11/07/2025 - Setting up and beginning data exploration

The first step is always the hardest of any project so I decided that I would spend a while thinking about what I wanted to achieve and the best way to go about that. I also had to decide on where to start with my project as "Football Analysis" is a very broad term.

For starters, I decided to focus my investigation on the 24/25 Premier League season, as not only is it very recent, but it is the football competition that I know the most about so I may have further insight.

### Achieved

- Found the source of my data - FBref
- Began importing the data that I wanted into R
- Made my first somewhat unhelpful visualisations:

![Plots average age in teams vs the number of goals scored](/content/docs/projects/football-analysis/blog_images/AgeVsGoals.png)
![Histogram of the average age of teams](/content/docs/projects/football-analysis/blog_images/AgeDist.png)

### What's Next

- Make some more helpful visualisations to identify some relationships or interesting ideas
