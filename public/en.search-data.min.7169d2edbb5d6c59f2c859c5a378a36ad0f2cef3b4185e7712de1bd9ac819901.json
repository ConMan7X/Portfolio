This project has been greatly inspired by the sheer number of services that require subscriptions, the pricing of those subscriptions, and finally the desire to be in control of my own data.\nStep One: Acquiring the Hardware # Hardware being the first step in a project like this can definitely be very daunting, as it often requires quite a large investment for something that you haven\u0026rsquo;t even experimented with yet. Luckily, I had gotten a taste of self hosting some very basic services on my old macbook pro that was sitting covered in dust, forgotten from my high school days. This small bit of experience had given me the confidence and the desire to make a bigger investment.\nMy plan has always been to purchase a small mini computer that would be low in power consumption but has expandability for future requirements, especially storage. This idea ruled out a Raspberry Pi for my needs as any expandability would increase connections or complexity of the machine. The price or Raspberry Pi\u0026rsquo;s was also a major factor, with even older generations costing more than $150 in Australia. I settled on finding a small Dell or Lenovo mini PC, preferably used on eBay for extra savings.\nAfter many weeks of looking around at the different options on eBay or refurbished sites, I finally started placing bids on a 7th Gen Intel Leonovo Mini PC with 8GB of RAM. In the end, I managed to snag a used one for $150AUD. I landed on this specific PC as the 7th Gen Intel chips are capable of hardware transcoding H.265/HEVC that I figured would be worth the extra $30 while i\u0026rsquo;m setting up my whole operation.\nStep Two: Deciding on an Operating System # Step Three: Starting the Servers # "},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/projects/data-story/","title":"Data Story","section":"Projects","content":" Data Story # Australia\u0026rsquo;s Reliance on Mining # November 2023\nThis project focused on exploring data and research available online to explore a topic of interest. The main goal was to develop my data visualisation and communication skills.\nLinkedIn Post\nWe don’t know how long our minerals will last for, so why are 60% of our exports from mining?\nThis is a data story looking into the future of the Australian mining industry and how sustainable it is. As part of my COMM2501 project, I delved into how the industry affects both the economy and environment as well as how action should be taken to prepare Australia for the future.\nMy name is Connor Schicht, and I am a UNSW student studying Actuarial Studies and Computer Science. Throughout this project, I have developed many skills in data visualisation and communication but have also improved my ability to source and implement feedback in my work. Some of this feedback included making sure to consider the perspective of the audience when writing or creating as well as focusing on not adding unnecessary information.\nTechnology Utilised: Tableau, Excel, Microsoft Powerpoint\n"}]
