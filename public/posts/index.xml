      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&#xA;  Introduction&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#introduction&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I have been inspired to use my own hardware and storage to self host my own private information, private entertainment,&#xA;and any other private services I may want to host. This project has been greatly inspired by the sheer number of services that&#xA;require subscriptions, the pricing of those subscriptions, and finally the desire to be in control of my own data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-one-acquiring-the-hardware&#34;&gt;&#xA;  Step One: Acquiring the Hardware&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#step-one-acquiring-the-hardware&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hardware being the first step in a project like this can definitely be very daunting, as it often requires quite a large investment&#xA;for something that you haven&amp;rsquo;t even experimented with yet. Luckily, I had gotten a taste of self hosting some very basic services&#xA;on my old macbook pro that was sitting covered in dust, forgotten from my high school days. This small bit of experience had&#xA;given me the confidence and the desire to make a bigger investment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
