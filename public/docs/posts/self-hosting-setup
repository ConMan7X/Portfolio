## Introduction

Recently, I have been inspired to use my own hardware and storage to self host my own private information, private entertainment,
and any other private services I may want to host. This project has been greatly inspired by the sheer number of services that
require subscriptions, the pricing of those subscriptions, and finally the desire to be in control of my own data.

## Step One: Acquiring the Hardware

Hardware being the first step in a project like this can definitely be very daunting, as it often requires quite a large investment
for something that you haven't even experimented with yet. Luckily, I had gotten a taste of self hosting some very basic services
on my old macbook pro that was sitting covered in dust, forgotten from my high school days. This small bit of experience had
given me the confidence and the desire to make a bigger investment.

My plan has always been to purchase a small mini computer that would be low in power consumption but has expandability
for future requirements, especially storage. This idea ruled out a Raspberry Pi for my needs as any expandability would
increase connections or complexity of the machine. The price or Raspberry Pi's was also a major factor, with even older
generations costing more than $150 in Australia. I settled on finding a small Dell or Lenovo mini PC, preferably used
on eBay for extra savings.
