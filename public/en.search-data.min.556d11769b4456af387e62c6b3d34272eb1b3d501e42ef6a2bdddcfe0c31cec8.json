As part of my COMM2501 project, I delved into how the industry affects both the economy and environment as well as how action should be taken to prepare Australia for the future.\nMy name is Connor Schicht, and I am a UNSW student studying Actuarial Studies and Computer Science. Throughout this project, I have developed many skills in data visualisation and communication but have also improved my ability to source and implement feedback in my work. Some of this feedback included making sure to consider the perspective of the audience when writing or creating as well as focusing on not adding unnecessary information.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/experience/","title":"Experience","section":"Docs","content":" Experience # Bunnings - Trade Desk Team Member (2022 - Current) # Price and organise stock for delivery and collection for both commercial and consumer customers Collaborate with team members to negotiate delivery dates and organize picking Provide excellent service to customers both face to face and over the phone "},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/projects/","title":"Projects","section":"Docs","content":" Projects # This is a collection of various projects I have completed.\n"}]
